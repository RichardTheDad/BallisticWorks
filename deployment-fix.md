# Railway Deployment Fix

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Removed Problematic nixpacks.toml
- Railway was failing on Nix package installation
- Switched to standard Node.js detection with custom Dockerfile

### 2. Created Optimized Dockerfile
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine (smaller, faster)
- Installs native build tools for SQLite3
- Proper multi-stage dependency installation
- Creates required directories

### 3. Updated Build Configuration
- Simplified railway.json with direct build command
- Added postinstall script for automatic client dependency installation
- Better error handling and compatibility

### 4. Fixed Route Ordering
- Routes are now properly defined before catch-all React route
- Prevents API routes from being intercepted

## Deploy Again:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment with Docker configuration"
git push
```

Railway will now use the Dockerfile for a more reliable build process!
